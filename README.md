## About

This portfolio website was modeled after popular music streaming sites and showcases myself as the "Artist". Projects are included as "songs" with playable "music videos" in both PIP(Picture in Picture) and maximized views. Other details are included in an "Album" carousels built from scratch using pure CSS and JavaScript. Website is mobile and desktop friendly!
